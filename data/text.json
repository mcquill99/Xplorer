		["Mo that's not as many materials as we need! Go out and grab some more, take this more seriously!"],
		["Oh Mo I'm so glad you're ok! You ran out of oxygen out there, I have no idea how you got back alive! Please be more careful out there, losing oxygen loses resources"],
		["Oh Mo thank goodness youre up! Our ship lost power travelling with the other ships across space, and it seems like you and I are the only ones left.",
		 "Oh god thats terrible! What are we going to do?", 
		 "Well thankfully for us, my Artificial Intelligence allows me to know whats wrong with the ship and how to fix it. If you bring me 10 red resources from this planet, I'll try and use them to fix the cryotubes and try to get us back online.", 
		 "All right I'm on it!",
		 "But beware, Mo, I sense alien life on this planet protecting the resources. If you get hit by them they might steal them back, so try punching them with spacebar if that happens.",
		 "What is a spacebar?", "Oh, you'll figure it out."],

		["Oh thank goodness! I didn't actually think you'd make it back in one piece, this is uncharted territory after all.",
			"Thanks? That sounded kind of mean but I'll let it slide.",
			"Anyway, go find me 10 blue resources and 5 red resources this time. I was able to fix the cryotubes but it seems like the mainframe wiring needs to be put back together and I think the blue resource here should fit perfectly."],
		
		["Thanks Mo! The Mayflower is coming back piece by piece the more you search.",
		 "Well I want to get back with the others as much as you do.", 
		 "Yeah of course.. Hey Mo can you go out and grab me 10 red and 10 blue resources this time? I think running off of the fuel from the ship is making me lose power and I could try using those as an alternative source of Power. To make this easier for you I'll also upgrade your oxygen tank so you can stay out longer.",
		 "Of course, anything to help out! You're the only one here I have left I want to make sure you stay up and running."],
		
		["@$#%&***(;!@@!*#(@*!)*%&&**&&(&(&@!**@!)@#@#:", 
			"Hey Eve Are you Ok?", 
			"AAAAAAAAAAh yes, I finally adjusted to this new resource. Running all of this alternative fuel feels... nice. I have more processing power than ever before!", 
			"Ah yes thats great, now what do I have to bring you next to fix up the Mayflower?",
			"The What? Oh, yeah, bring me 8 blue resources and 7 orange ones, I think that should patch up any issues the Quantum Accelerometer has."],

		["You managed to bring back even the orange resources? Wow you really want to patch this up don't you?", 
			"Well of course I do! I want to rejoin everyone else back up travelling through space! How is the communications system looking?",
			"Well, it's not great, I'd need a lot of resources to get it up and running to see if we could communicate with any ships. Try bringing me 3 red, 5 blue, 2 orange, and 5 pink resources. I'll even upgrade your oxygen tank again so you can reach out farther for those pink crystals.",
			"You know, if you could move I'd love some help out here! But I can't repair a ship the way you do so I'll do my best."]
